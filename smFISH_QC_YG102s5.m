% change these 2 folders to match your local folder structure:
addpath('/Users/iandardani/Code/dentist2') % dentist2
addpath('/Users/iandardani/Code/rajlabimagetools') % if don't have this, wil get this error: Undefined function 'scale' for input arguments of type 'uint16'. Note that it includes a function 'scale.m' which is also the name of functions in various MATLAB toolboxes



sigma=1; % theoretically, the point spread function at 60X/1.4NA with 2x2 camera binning should have sigma of 0.4. Go larger than this. dentist2's default is 2.
aTrousMinThreshFactor=1.5; % only output spots into spots.csv that are 1.5-fold lower than the threshold (if one is provided), otherwise 1.5-fold lower than the autothreshold for a given block). Eg. if threshold provided is 45, then every spots 30 or greater will be in spots.csv, although all spots <45 will have valid=false
launchGUI=true; % false to run a continuous loop to process spots for all subregions in a batch. Then, afterwards, you can turn to true to QC check these. The second time you run launchD2ThresholdGUI there will be a spots.csv table in the folder, and it will take these instead of finding spots again
